    <p>This is my favorite place throughout the trip -- The Alhambra Palace. <br>It is one of the best preserved Islamic Palaces and witnessed the prosperity of the Nastrid period. <br> Thankfully, it was protected and preserved by the monarchs even after the Catholic conquest of Granada.<br>
      The Alhambra is one of the most famous monuments of Islamic architecture and one of the most visited tourist sites in Spain. <br>Islamic-period influence and Moorish architecture are also preserved in the Albaicín neighborhood and other medieval monuments in the city. <br>The 16th century also saw a flourishing of Mudéjar architecture and Renaissance architecture, followed later by Baroque and Churrigueresque styles. <br>Granada is also well known within Spain for the University of Granada which has an estimated 47,000 undergraduate students spread over five different campuses in the city. The pomegranate (in Spanish, granada) is the heraldic device of Granada.

    <p>If you visit Gaudi's works in Barcelona, you will notice that he was heavily influenced by the Moorish patterns of stone carving and arch design; this is especially evident in the Sagrada Familia. <br> If you plan to visit Granada in the summer, definitely try Arab baths and Iberian ham with melon!<br>
      Granada was settled since ancient times by Iberians, Romans, and Visigoths. The current settlement became a major city of Al-Andalus in the 11th century during the Zirid Taifa of Granada. <br>In the 13th century it became the capital of the Emirate of Granada under Nasrid rule, the last Muslim-ruled state in the Iberian Peninsula. <br>Granada was conquered in 1492 by the Catholic Monarchs and progressively transformed into a Christian city over the course of the 16th century.

    <p>This picture features the Hall of Two Sisters -- the dome follows islamic conventions and serves as a metaphor for the cosmic universe. <br>With the changing light throughout the day, different dimensions of the dome shine like stars.
