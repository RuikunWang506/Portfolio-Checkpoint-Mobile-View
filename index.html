    <p>Hello! My name is Ruikun and welcome to my photography page! <br>As you browse through the photos, please let me know if you're interested in visiting these places.<br>Southern Europe is focused on the three peninsulas located in the extreme south of the European continent. <br>These are the Iberian Peninsula, the Apennine Peninsula, and the Balkan Peninsula.<br> These three peninsulas are separated from the rest of Europe by towering mountain ranges, respectively by the Pyrenees, the Alps and the Balkan Mountains. <br>The location of these peninsulas in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, as well as their mountainous reliefs, provide them with very different types of climates (mainly subtropical Mediterranean) from the rest of the continent. <br>So, the Sirocco hot wind that originates in the heart of the Sahara blows over Italy, going up to the interior of the Alpine arc (Po Valley). The Alps prevent the Sirocco from spreading to the rest of Europe. 
    </p>

    <p>The photos on this site capture my travel trajectory during the summer. <br>I had so much fun throughout the three months, and it turns out that I spent less than one semester's tuition! <br> On these pages, I recorded my favourite moments throughout the trip. However, I was not able to capture and record everything. <br>It also makes me a bit sad knowing that I will be trapped in Ann Arbor for two years, and I'm still hoping to make time during the winter for a Colorado ski trip. In terms of future travel plans, I am planning to go to Mexico during the spring break next year and go to Peru and Chile during the summer break (hopefully also getting an internship in between).
